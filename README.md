## 💼 Business Problem Statement
In high-volume sales environments, leadership often lacks the real-time visibility required to align individual agent performance with regional revenue targets. Without a centralized analytics tool, it is difficult to identify whether missed targets are due to specific regional economic shifts, product-line underperformance, or workforce efficiency gaps.

This dashboard serves **Sales Directors and Operations Managers** by providing a comprehensive view of performance metrics, allowing for data-driven interventions in coaching, inventory allocation, and fiscal forecasting.

## 🔍 Objective of the Analysis
The primary goal of this project is to translate complex transactional data into actionable strategic intelligence:
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare Actual Sales vs. Forecasted targets to assess budget accuracy.
* **Geospatial Intelligence:** Identify high-performing hubs and market penetration across the US.
* **Product Vitality:** Analyze category contributions (Lilac, Kerria, Malva, etc.) to optimize the product mix.
* **Workforce Productivity:** Evaluate agent-level contribution to identify top talent and training needs.

## 🧩 Analysis Approach
1. **Data Engineering:** Ingested and cleaned five core dimensions (Agent, Product, Region, Team, and Fiscal Parameters).
2. **Modeling:** Established a Star Schema architecture, connecting the `_sales` fact table to dimensions via optimized 1:N relationships.
3. **Visualization Design:** Adopted an executive dark theme for high-contrast readability, utilizing a grid-based layout for logical flow.
4. **Interactivity:** Integrated synchronized slicers for Fiscal Year (2021-2025) and Regional filters to allow for "slice-and-dice" exploration.

## 💡 Key Findings & Insights
* **Forecast Accuracy:** Analysis reveals specific periods of over-forecasting, indicating a need for more conservative baseline modeling in future quarters.
* **Market Concentration:** Hubs like **New York (C01)** and **Seattle (C02)** remain the primary revenue engines, contributing significantly to the total bottom line.
* **Category Performance:** The **Lilac** and **Kerria** product lines show the highest velocity, suggesting strong market-fit compared to niche categories.
